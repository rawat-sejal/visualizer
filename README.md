Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer
What is this project?
This is an interactive web-based learning tool designed to help students, developers, and anyone interested in computer science understand data structures and algorithms through visual representation. Instead of just reading about these concepts in textbooks, you can see them in action with step-by-step animations.
Why was this created?
Learning data structures and algorithms can be challenging and often boring when done through traditional methods. This project addresses that by:
Making complex concepts visual and engaging
Showing the step-by-step process of how algorithms work
Helping users understand the "why" behind different approaches
Improving memory retention through interactive learning
What can you do with this tool?
üéØ Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: Watch how adjacent elements are compared and swapped
Selection Sort: See how the smallest element is repeatedly selected
Quick Sort: Observe the divide-and-conquer approach with pivot elements
Insertion Sort: Visualize how elements are inserted into their correct positions
üîç Searching Algorithms
Linear Search: See how elements are checked one by one
Binary Search: Watch the efficient divide-and-conquer search method
üìä Data Structures
Arrays: Understand basic array operations
Stacks: See the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle in action
Queues: Visualize the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle
Key Features
‚úÖ Interactive Interface: Input your own data or generate random arrays
