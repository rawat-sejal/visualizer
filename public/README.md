## Introduction

The Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based project designed to make learning about data structures and algorithms more engaging and easier to understand through visualization. Traditional methods of learning these concepts can be boring and difficult to grasp. Visualization has been proven to enhance memory retention and understanding. This project visualizes one of the most important aspects of computer science: data structures and algorithms. The project is divided into three main sections: sorting, searching, and data structures.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Visualize linear and binary search algorithms.
- **Data Structures:** Visualize fundamental data structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input custom data, generate random data, and observe the step-by-step execution of algorithms.

## Usage

To use the Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer, open the index.html file in your web browser. The main interface will provide options to select different data structures and algorithms. Users can input custom arrays, select an algorithm, and visualize the step-by-step process of sorting, searching, or manipulating data structures.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
